# Integrify Design Bootcamp

We are two junior web developers in training at Integrify (Helsinki, Finland); André is also a professional designer, and Xurxe has dabbled in all kinds of visual arts. Our teacher asked us to create and implement a design bootcamp for our classmates.

I developed a prep version of the project so I could rehearse my teaching for the actual bootcamp; you can find it at [this other GitHub repository](https://github.com/xurxe/integrify-design-bootcamp-prep/). You are currently looking at the version developed during the bootcamp itself, which took place on June 26th-28th 2019. 

Later, in August, a team of students from Integrify took over the project in order to finish for the client, Think Tank United.
